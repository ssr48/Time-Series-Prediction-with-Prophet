# Time-Series-Prediction-with-Prophet

This repository is comprised of two folders - "2_code" - which provides the code for time series analysis using Facebook's Prophet library in Jupyter Notebooks - and "3_res" - which provides the output files from the code file.

The code takes in deposit information from prior years as a proxy for enrollment and predicts future enrollment. It divides transfer and freshmen students separately and predicts enrollment for both sets of students using custom seasonality.
